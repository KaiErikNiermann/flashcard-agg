How does the ,movement of the basiliar membrane cause deplolarization/hyperpolarization ?	up movement&nbsp;<br>- this leads to the organ of corti moving up which leads to the steriocilla moving away from the kinocillium which leads to depolarization&nbsp;<br><br>down movement&nbsp;<br>- this leads to the organ of corti moving down which leads to the seriocilla moving towards the kinocillium which leads to hyperpolarization&nbsp;
How do the steriocilla cause an action potential (depolarization and hyperpolarization)?&nbsp;	depolarization&nbsp;<br>1. when the basiliar membrane moves up it leads to mechanically gates ion channels at the top of the steriocilla opening&nbsp;<br>2. the opening of the channels leads to a K+ influx which leads to depolarization of cell&nbsp;<br>3. depolarization leads to influx of calcium&nbsp;<br>4. calcium influx leads to vesicle membrane fusion and NT release, it also&nbsp;<br><br>hyperpolarization&nbsp;<br>1. when the basililar membrane moves down it leads to mechanically gated ion channels at tips to close&nbsp;<br>2. closing of ion channels Ca2+ also leads to K+ channels activating which leads K+ efflux and hence repolarization

What are spatial auditory cues ?&nbsp;	Spatial auditory cues are cues which suggest the spatial position of something&nbsp;
What are the main types of spatial auditory cues ?&nbsp;	spectral cues : These are single ear cues based on the distribution of incoming sound, which is defined by how sound interacts with your head and outer ear, so essentially the position of the head&nbsp;<br><br>binaural / interaural cues : These are double auditory cues and are based on the difference in intensity and time of a sound arriving in either ear, which is defined again by head position in respect to the sound source
What are the main factors that influence interaural auditory cues ?&nbsp;	interaural time difference (ITD)<br>the difference in time it takes a sound stimulus to reach one ear in comparison to the other, as one ear or the other moves closer to the sound source the ITD increases<br><br>interaurl intensity\level difference (IID)<br>the difference in the intensity of the sound in comparsion to one ear vs the other, intensity difference in large part is caused by the head shadow&nbsp;
Where is the localization of sound hard ?&nbsp;	Cone of confusion&nbsp;<br>A cone shaped region to the side of the head from which its hard to localize sounds due to the fact that interaural cues are ambiguous anywhere within the cone of confusion. Leads to the perception that a sound is coming from inside your head (e.g. headphones)
What is the sound shadow ?	Its the region of space cast by your head that blocks a sound source leading to some ITD and IID&nbsp;

What is the importance of the canal positions ?&nbsp;	All the canals on contralateral sides are orthogonal which is what enables the ability for perceiving angular acceleration&nbsp;
What is the general anatomy of the individual hair cell bundles ?&nbsp;	So you have a cluster of stereocilla which means you got the tip linked mechanical gated ion channels, you also got a kinocillium on one end of the bundle, and for all bundles the kinocillium is oriented in the same direction.
What are the different types of hair cells and their anatomies ?&nbsp;	Type 1 hair cells<br>- function : transmit information about changes in head position and movement&nbsp;<br>- anatomy : small afferent and efferent nerve terminals&nbsp;<br><br>Type 2 hair cells<br>- function : focused on maintaining static equilibrium&nbsp;<br>- anatomy : large myleninated afferent nerve terminal and a nerve calyx which surrounds cell&nbsp;
What anatomical feature makes sure that the hair cells in the vestibular system bend back ?&nbsp;	Its the circular plate which appears to be at the base of the hair bundle, im not researching if thats exactly correct, diagrams make it seem like it is&nbsp;
What is the anatomy of the larger structure in the semicircular canals that enables orientation perception ?&nbsp;	So you have many type 1 and 2 hair cell bundles (stereocilla + kinocillium), they are all surrounded by a gel like cap called the cupula, and all of the hair cell bundles in the cupula are embedded into the supporting cells and innvervated by nerve fibers&nbsp;
What is the general process for how a certain type of acceleration might be detected ?&nbsp;	1. Head moves along some axis (e.g. x axis/nodding)<br>2. Angular acceleration leads to inverse movement of fluid in the two contralateral anterior canals/ducts&nbsp;<br>3. The movement of fluid in turn bends the cupula which in turn bends the hair cell bundles in the cupula&nbsp;<br>4. Bending of the hair cell bundles towards the kinocillium leads to a K+ influx&nbsp;<br>5. This causes the cell to depolarize which leads to an influx of Ca2+ which again causes vescile fusion with the membrane which causes NT release and hence an AP&nbsp;
How does the positioning of contralateral canals enable accurate accurate acceleration detection ?&nbsp;	So they are orthogonally positioned, this means when you move the head in any angular way one cristae is going to move all hair cell bundles one way and inversly for the other side, since all hair cell bundles are in the same cupula it means they all either cause an exitatory signal or inhibitory signal. Since orthgonal positioning leads to opposite reactions one side is gonna be exitatory and the other inhibitory, which allows for the encoding of different types of angular acceleration.
What is the name of the structures in the canals that together enable orientation perception ?&nbsp;	The cupula, type 1 and 2 hair cells, circular plate, hair cell body, surrounding support cell and afferent and efferent nerve fibers together makeup the cristae, i think, thats what it seemed like
What is the point of the endolymph ?&nbsp;	It has a high potassium concetration so when the stereocilla open their tip linked mechanical ion channels there is an electrochemical gradient which leads to the influx of K+ which in turn depolarizeses the cell and allows for calcium to do its whole shabang&nbsp;
What is the broad anatomy of both of the otolith organs ?&nbsp;	- striola : which is like a central line across the organ which determines the orientation of the kinocilium on either side&nbsp;<br>- otoconia : top layer of the organs covered in these crystals that i think just help the hair cells beneath in determining linear acceleration and gravity&nbsp;<br>- otolithic membrane : which is just the membrane surrounding the hair cell bundles&nbsp;
How are the kinocilium oriented in the otolithic organs and why?	urticle&nbsp;<br>- on either side the kinocilum are oriented towards the striola&nbsp;<br>- why : one side will depolarize and the other will hyperpolarize depending on the position of the stereocilla, so i think it gives that whole like inhibition-exictation coding but in one contained unit&nbsp;<br><br>saccule&nbsp;<br>- on either side kinocillium are oriented&nbsp;<b>away&nbsp;</b>from striola&nbsp;<br>- why : so the same way how you have they coding for individual otolithic organs you also have the coding for both organs so one undergoes a certain pattern while the other has another type of pattern, i think, thats what makes the most sense to me&nbsp;
What type of things do the two otolithic organs detect ?	urticle&nbsp;<br>- it detects linear acceleration so like when you start walking for example<br><br>saccule&nbsp;<br>- detects gravity, so for example when you crouch down or when you are laying down&nbsp;
What is the vestibuocular reflex ?&nbsp;	Its the head reflex which controls the eye movements to stabilize images during head movements, or i guess the reflex which fixes eyes to a specific object when moving, but yes&nbsp;

What could spontaneous nystagmus be an indication of ?&nbsp;	A head injury which is effecting the semicircular canals&nbsp;
How does the caloric test work ?&nbsp;	The caloric test determines any issues with your vestibular system&nbsp;<br>It works by putting cold water in one ear and seeing if there is an opposite nytagmus&nbsp;<br>and warm water in the other ear and seeing if there is a same side nystagmus&nbsp;<br>if this does not happen then there could be some issues with the vestibular system&nbsp;<br><br>remember with the acronym COWS : cold-opposite , warm-same

Taste buds consist of multiple taste cells.&nbsp;<br>Each taste cell has taste hairs or pores which detect certain tastes.&nbsp;<br>The taste cell body is what initizes the depolarizing action once a taste is detected.<br>The gustatory afferect axons are then what transmit the AP to the brain.
How does taste generate an AP ?&nbsp;	1. There is some taste specific activity on the membrane which leads to a depolarization of the taste cell.&nbsp;<br>2. This depolarization leads to the standard influx of Ca2+ ions&nbsp;<br>3. Influx of Ca2+ leads to NT containing vesicle fusion with membrane and exocytosis of NT across synaptic cleft&nbsp;<br>4. This leads to an AP being generated in the postsynapic gustatory axos which encode taste
What are some key notes about the taste sensitivity of taste cells ?&nbsp;	- they can be sensitive to multiple tastes&nbsp;<br>- they can be sensitive to different tastes in the same taste bud&nbsp;
What are the two main types of coding for taste cells ?&nbsp;	Labelled line coding&nbsp;<br>Since most taste cells only respond to one taste, an action potential being generated in the corresponding gustatory axon generally corresponds to this taste stimuli.<br><br>Population coding&nbsp;<br>An ensemble of gustatory axons encodes a specific taste as some combination of synchronize parallel AP's.&nbsp;
What is the gustatory pathway ?&nbsp;	Its the pathway through the body from the gustatory nerves eminating from the taste buds to the gustatory cortex.
What are the main components of the gustatory pathway ?&nbsp;	1. We have 3 nerves that innervate the tongue : facial, cranial, and vagus&nbsp;<br>2. These 3 nerves project to the nucleus of the solitary in the gray matter of the medulla<br>3. From the nucleus of the solitary the nerves project into the ventro-posterio medial part of the thalamus<br>4. From the VPM the thalamic neurons now project to the gustatory cortex
Do other factors play a role in the perception of taste ? If yes which ones.&nbsp;	Yes they do, perception of taste is a combination of various factors. Some other factors which play a role are&nbsp;<br>- Aroma of the food&nbsp;<br>- Expectation&nbsp;<br>- Color&nbsp;<br>- Temperature&nbsp;<br>- Satiety&nbsp;
What is capsacin and what are its effects ?&nbsp;	Capsacin is the main ingredient in spicy foods. It releases substance P from the nociceptors which in turn leads to&nbsp;<br>- vasodilation&nbsp;<br>- histamine release&nbsp;<br>- hyperalgesia ( hypersensitivity to pain )

What is the anatomy of the olfactors system ?&nbsp;	1. At the top of the nasal passage you have ciliated olfactory receptor epithelial cells which can detect odors&nbsp;<br>2. A depolarizing action potential is projected through the cribiform plate where the olfactory cells synapse with dendrites of the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb<br><br>Summary&nbsp;<br>Olfactory receptor epithelium&nbsp;<br>Olfactory receptor cells<br>Through cribiform plate&nbsp;<br>Synapse with mitral cells in olfactory bulb&nbsp;
What is the olfactory trandsdunction mechanism ?&nbsp;	1. Odor molecules bind to some specific receptor protien&nbsp;<br>2. Receptor protien leads triggers generation of cAMP signaling messager<br>3. cAMP messanger causes an influx of CA2+<br>4. Ca2+ leads to Cl- efflux&nbsp;<br>5. Cl- efflux leads to membrane depolarization which ends up generating an action potential in the mitral cells&nbsp;
What is the pathway of the olfactory system ?&nbsp;	There are two main pathways&nbsp;<br>1. Mitral cells in olfactory bulb -&gt; olfactory cortex&nbsp;<br>2. Mitral cells in olfactory bumb -&gt; pyriform cortex -&gt; thalamus -&gt; orbitofrontal cortex
What are pheromones ?&nbsp;	Pheromones are&nbsp;<b>airborne chemicals&nbsp;</b>released from animals that have&nbsp;<b>physiological&nbsp;</b>or&nbsp;<b>behavioral&nbsp;</b>effects on another.
How are pheromones detected in humans ?	Via the <b>vomeronasal organ (VMO)&nbsp;</b>its located in the soft tissue of the nasal septum in the nasal cavity, and it detects pheromones throuh cell bodies with receptors for specific chemicals such as pheromones.
What is the Mchillock effect ?&nbsp;	Its an example of how pheromones can induce physiological changes, it states that women living in close proximity will have a synchronization of their mentural cycles due to pheromones.
What is synesthesia ?&nbsp;	Its the capacity to combine sensory experiences across sensory modalities.
What are spinal reflexes ?&nbsp;	They are reflexes, so muscle movements, intiated by the autonomic system and sent through the spinal cor , so they require no concious thought. These reflexes are responsible for involuntary movmements and are thus essential for involuntary things like posture and balance.
What are the two important tracts for voluntary movement ?&nbsp;	Its the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts which connect the spinal cord and brainstem to the brain.&nbsp;
What is skeletal muscle ?&nbsp;	Its the type of musle generally involved with visible movement.&nbsp;
What are the properties of skeletal muscle ?&nbsp;	Striated : It has a striped appearance due to being made of muscle fibers&nbsp;<br>Contraction : This is the main action of muscle shortening to initiate movement&nbsp;<br>Work in pairs : There is an antagonistc action where one muscle generally contracts while the other relaxes&nbsp;<br>Activation : Its stimulated by AP's in the efferent neurons which release NT's at the neuromuscular junction
What are the two layers of muscle fibers and their functions ?&nbsp;	extrafusual layer - outer&nbsp;<br>Responsible for muscle contraction by APs from the alpha motor neuron&nbsp;<br><br>intrafusual layer - inner&nbsp;<br>Sends information about the muscle to the brain using afferent gamma motor neurons&nbsp;
What is the motor unit ?&nbsp;	It refers to the collection of extrafusal muscle fibers which are collectively innervated by one efferent alpha motor neuron.
What is the muscle spindle feedback circuit ?&nbsp;	Its the main pathway of alpha and gamma motor neurons to the brain
What is the main process of the muscle spindle feedback circuit ?&nbsp;	1. You have afferent spindle neurons which provide sensory input to the dorsal horn&nbsp;<br>2. The afferent spindle nurons synapse with the efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons&nbsp;<br>- the alpha motor neurons handle the contractions of the extrafusal muscle fibers&nbsp;<br>- the gamma motor neurons maintain the tension on the intrafusal muscle spindles so they can keep detecting change&nbsp;
What defines the degree of dexterity for a muscle ?&nbsp;	Since desterity corresponds to how finely you can contract a muscle it depends on the ratio of extrafusal muscle fibers to innervating efferent alpha motor neurons.
What is the specific process that generations an AP leading to a muscle contraction ?&nbsp;	1. AP in the afferent alpha motor neuron at the NMJ&nbsp;<br>2. AP leads to release of Ca2+ which leads to exocytosis of acetylechlone NT across NMJ<br>3. acetylecholine NT binds to nicotinic receptors&nbsp;<br>4. bindng of NT to nictonic receptors leads to generation of End Plate Potential which leads to muscle contraction&nbsp;<br><br>Summary<br>Presynaptic AP arrival<br>Acetylecholine NT release and binding to nicotic rececptors&nbsp;<br>Generation of EPP -&gt; muscle contraction
What part of the muscle system allows for the automatic maintance of limb position ?&nbsp;	This is one of the primary functions of the efferent gamma motor neuron.&nbsp;
How does the automatic maintance of limb position happen ?&nbsp;	The efferent gamma motor neurons regulate the tension on the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles such that they can contiously detect changes of muscle strech and respond with certain signals accordinly to for example maintain the muscle at a specific level of contraction.
What is meant by reciprocal innervation / antagonistic action ?&nbsp;	It refers to the idea of how muscle groups work in pairs. That is, when one muscle contracts, the opposing muscle in the pair relaxes.&nbsp;
How does antagonistc action / recpirocal innervention work ?&nbsp;	1. Some kind of stimulus elicits reaction&nbsp;<br>2. Sensory neurons excite two types of interneurons&nbsp;<br>- exitatory spinal interneurons which lead to muscle contraction<br>- inhibitory spinal interneurons which lead to muscle relaxation&nbsp;<br><br>So we have one muscle being excited and another being inhibited.&nbsp;
What is meant by final common path ?&nbsp;	Its just the name given to alpha motor neurons because all signals that relate to movement ultimatly end up in them before triggering a contraction.&nbsp;
What are the 3 main tracts related to motor control and their function ?&nbsp;	corticospinal tract : voluntary movement to distal extremities&nbsp;<br>corticoburospinal tract : involuntary motion&nbsp;<br>corticubulbar pathway : control over fascial muscles (e.g. swallowing, tounge, eye movements)
What lobe is important in generating the intention to move ?&nbsp;	The parietal lobe&nbsp;
What is the organization of the primary motor cortex ?&nbsp;	Its topographic, meaning that specific areas corresponding to muscle groups are represented by close neurons in the primary motor cortex. This also gives rise to the motor homunculus in which the cortical representation of muscle groups corresponds to the physical area of those muscle groups.
What do microstimulation of the different motocortices show ?&nbsp;	In the M1 contraction of joints and in M2 contraction of specific muscle groups. So from lower to higher cortical regions there is a transition from broad movement to more specific movement.
How are muscle contractions encoded ?&nbsp;	Efferent spindle neurons encode muscle contractions by the rate of action potentials, a more intense muscle contraction corresponds to a higher rate of APs, that is, we are using activity coding.
What does directional-selectivity mean in the context of the motor system ?&nbsp;	It refers tot he fact that corticospinal neurons that generate movement are selective for specific directions of movement.
What are some examples of disorders of the motor system ?&nbsp;	Huntingtons desease&nbsp;<br>Progressive destruction of the basal ganglia&nbsp;<br><br>Muscular distrophy&nbsp;<br>Abnormality of Ca2+ utilization which leads to muscular distrophy&nbsp;<br><br>Parkinsons disease&nbsp;<br>Ok the reasonsing is too confusing its just something bad happening which leads to some neurons going byebye

What are the divisions of the ANS and their function ?	Sympathetic division&nbsp;<br>Controls ANS processes during stress allowing for faster reactions&nbsp;<br><br>Parasympathetic division&nbsp;<br>Controls ANS processes during resting conditions which allows your body to regenerate and undergo maintenance
How does the adrenal medulla relate to the sympathetic nervous system ?&nbsp;	1. Preganglionic fibers innervate the adrenal medulla<br>2. When you are in a stressfull situation neuroendocrine cells are told to release andrenaline to organs and systems throughout the body&nbsp;<br>3. Adrenaline effects multiple receptors throughout the body and intiates the whole fight or flight relfex thing&nbsp;&nbsp;
What are the properties of the ganglionc fibers in the sympathic division of the ANS ?&nbsp;	<b>Preganglionic fibers are short </b>and <b>postganglionic fibers are long</b>. I don't exactly know why, my guess would be it has something to do with wanting to be close to the ganglionic neurons, maybe. Or maybe its just some random property.
What is the most important nerve involved in parasympathetic activity ?&nbsp;	Its the vagus nerve, it innvervates a bunch of target organs and it provides 75% of the parasympathetic outflow. Do I know what that means, not really, maybe 75% of the activity ? Idk, its just important for parasympathetic activtiy. Vagus nerve cool.
What are the properties of the ganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division of the ANS ?&nbsp;	Its the opposite as for the sympathetic division. Preganglionic fibers are the long ones and postganglionic fibers are the shorter ones, this allows for a localized and fast activation of the parasympathic system on the relevant organs. I think, thats how I had it in my notes, would sorta make sense, maybe. Idk.&nbsp;
What is the secret 3rd division of the ANS ?&nbsp;	Its the enteric nervous system, its responsible for dealing with involuntary things related to the process of digestion, like persitalsis
What are the main features of the ENS ?&nbsp;	- has a bunch of neurons&nbsp;<br>- controls complex locally coordinatied visceral reflexes&nbsp;<br>- is an extensive network in the digestive tract&nbsp;
What is autonomic tone and why is it important ?&nbsp;	It defines how ANS nerves function in respect to their baseline activity&nbsp;<br><br>inactive baseline&nbsp;<br>nerves with an inactive baseline can only increase activity, so i think this means they can only be excitatory&nbsp;<br><br>background activity baseline&nbsp;<br>nerves which as a basline have some background activity can be both exictatory or inhibitory&nbsp;<br><br>Summary<br>inactive -&gt; excitatory&nbsp;<br>inactive/background -&gt; excitatory/inhibitory
What does viscera mean or like kinda stand for ?&nbsp;	It just expresses things that relate to internal organs. So visceral effectors are just things which have an effect on the functioning of internal organs.

What are some examples of vegitative and endocrine functions ?&nbsp;	- cardiovascular regulation&nbsp;<br>- body temperature regulation<br>- body water regulation<br>- uterin contractilty and breast milk ejection<br>- gastrointentinal and feeding regulation&nbsp;
What are the effects of stimulating the lateral hypothalamus ?&nbsp;	Increased thirst and eating&nbsp;
What is a key property of the hypothalamus ?&nbsp;	The fact that its made of different nuclei which are associated with different drives and emotions, furthermore if we stimulate these different nuclei we can therefore effect these drives and emotions
What is the main function of the reward and punishment centers ?&nbsp;	They are the limbic structures which are conerned with the affective nature of sensory sensation, that is, the emotions which attribute to specific sensations.
What is meant by the affective nature of sensory sensation ?&nbsp;	It refers to the interpretation of how pleasant or unpleasant a specific sensation is&nbsp;
What is a technique used for the localization of reward and punishment centers ?&nbsp;	Self-stimulation of different brain areas and seeing if this yields a positive or negative response, if the animal feels pleasure then this is likely a reward center.
Where are the reward centers located ?&nbsp;	Along the medial forebrain bundle, lateral and ventromedial nuclei of hypothalamus
What are the effects of different stimulation intensities on the reward centers ?&nbsp;	Weaker stimulation leads to a sense of reward/happiness and stronger stimulation leads to a feeling of punishment.
What are some less potent reward centers ?&nbsp;	- septum&nbsp;<br>- amygdala&nbsp;<br>- certain areas of thalamus and basal ganglia&nbsp;
What are the locations of punishment centers ?&nbsp;	Central gray area surrounding aqueduct of sylvius in mesencephalon
Where are some less potent punishment areas ?&nbsp;	- amygdala&nbsp;<br>- hippocampus
What are the effects of strongly stimulating the punishment areas ?&nbsp;	- displeasure&nbsp;<br>- fear&nbsp;<br>- terror&nbsp;<br>- pain&nbsp;<br>- sickness
What is the importance of the reward and punishment centers ?&nbsp;	They control our actions, we tend to repeat rewarded actions but stop punished actions. Reward and punishment controls bodily actions, drives, motivations, aversions.
What is the relevance of punishment/reward centers to learning ?&nbsp;	habituation&nbsp;<br>- repeated exposure to neutral stimuli eventually means animal becomes habituated and ignores stimuli do to lack of any cortical response to it&nbsp;<br><br>reinforcement&nbsp;<br>- repeated exposure to punishing or rewarding stimuli means in turn repeated intense cortical response so a specific response (happiness/sadness) becomes reinforced, in other words learned&nbsp;
What is the main function of the hippocampus ?&nbsp;	Its involed in many processes, most prominantly memory and spatial orientation&nbsp;
What is the name of the cells relevant to spatial orientation ?&nbsp;	They are called place cells&nbsp;
What is an important aspect of the hippocampus ?&nbsp;	It can generate new neurons specifically if someone engaes alot in spatial reasoning tasks such as frequently thinking about how to navigate which engages the place cells and promotes generation of new cells
What are some important diseases that occur in the hippocampus ?&nbsp;	- Epileptic seizures often start in the hippocampus&nbsp;<br>- Lesions related to alzheimers also often start in the hippocampus
What is the role of learning in the hippocampus ?&nbsp;	The hippocampus is involved in the long-term consolidation of memories.
What happens if you remove the hippocampus ?&nbsp;	You no longer have consolidation of long-term memories, very sad
What are some sources of damage to the Hippocampus ?	- anoxia ( loss of oxygen supply )<br>- stress<br>- environmental toxins&nbsp;<br>- epileptogenic focus&nbsp;
What were the main effects of the bilateral removal of the hippocampus on the patient HM ?&nbsp;	- unable to form new declarative memories&nbsp;<br>- old memories were intact&nbsp;<br>- no change in intellect&nbsp;<br>- no problems with procedural memories
What are declarative memories ?&nbsp;	Declarative memory also called explicit memories are memories of things like names, dates, places, facts, events, so just factual explicit things that happened and are real or something yes&nbsp;
What is procedural memory ?&nbsp;	Its a type of&nbsp;<b>implicit (unconcious long-term) memory&nbsp;</b>which aids the performance of particular tasks without concious awareness of previous experiences, a good example of this is shit like learning to play the piano where its a repeated motor task which eventually leads to the neural systems being able to automatically produce the activity&nbsp;
What is the main role of the amygdala ?&nbsp;	Its known for attributing emotion to certain sensory perceptions, so like if you see something disgusting the amygdala is ig what evokes that corresponding disgust emotion
What is the relevance of the amygdala to emotion ?&nbsp;	Its responsible for learning and maintaing the link between a stimulus and its corresponding emotional value.
What are the main responses that come from stimulating the amygdala ?&nbsp;	- fear and anxiety&nbsp;<br>- deja vu&nbsp;
Abstractly what are the inputs and outputs to the amygdala ?&nbsp;	It gets highly processed sensory inputs from the limbic cortex and it has widespread outputs to most prominantly the&nbsp;<br>- hippocampus<br>- hypothalamus<br>- brainstem&nbsp;
What are the effects of a bilateral removal of the amygdala ?	The behavioral effects are as follows<br>- placid/flat affect&nbsp;<br>- fearless ( to traditionally fear inducing stimuli )<br>- inappropriate social and sexual behavior&nbsp;<br>- hyperoral and overly curious&nbsp;
What do the effects of removing the amygdala suggest about its functional role ?&nbsp;	The fact that all behavior effects broadly correspond to having some incorrect or no emotion towards certain things shows that it clearly plays a role in regulating and managing the correct emotional response to specific types of stimuli. For example one behavior effect was fearlessness, which means that this correspondence of fear emotion to fear inducing stimuli is lost.
What is the role of the amygdala in respect to behavior ?&nbsp;	It makes a persons behavioral response appropriate for the respective stimuli, so like fear inducing stimuli induces fear, innappropraite actions induce awkwardness so as to disincentivise their repition, and so on.
What are the functions of the limbic cortex ?&nbsp;	Its a broadly defined region that functons as the cerebral association area for control of behavior
What are some important circuits in the limbic cortex ?&nbsp;	The hippocampal circuit and the amygdala circuit&nbsp;
