moral theories	moral theories are systematizations ; they tell a general story on why it's okay to intervene in certain cases, but not in others ; they can be used to resolve moral dilemmas in a systematic and intelligent way
Desire Satisfaction	<b>fulfilling desires&nbsp;</b><br>Proposes intrinsic value derives from fulfilling desires, irrespective of their content.&nbsp; <br><br><b>preference &gt; pleasure&nbsp;</b><br>Challenges hedonism by prioritizing individual preferences over pleasure <br><br><b>preference not always good</b><br>Faces critique exemplified by Max the Masochist, highlighting situations where fulfilling desires doesn't lead to a good life outcome.
Objective List Theory	"<b>Objective list theories -&nbsp;</b>theory of&nbsp;<i>well-being</i><br>assert that well-being comprises various objectively valuable components, not just happiness <br><b><br>components include </b><br>- loving relationships, <br>- achievement, <br>- aesthetic appreciation, <br>- creativity, knowledge, etc., <br>seen as <i>intrinsic goods </i>;
<br><b><br>objectivity&nbsp;</b><br>The list is objective because it <span style=""font-weight:600"">applies universally, irrespective of individual feelings</span>, and diverse lives can realize different goods.
<br><b><br>improving goal preference</b><br>Objective list theories suggest <span style=""font-weight:600"">improving </span>someone's<span style=""font-weight:600""> preferences from worthless to worthwhile goals enhances well-being</span>, even if satisfaction remains unchanged."
Hedonism	<b>well-being</b><br>It's a theory of well-being <br><br><b>pleasure</b><br>Pleasure is the sole intrinsic value <br><br><b>more pleasure = better life</b><br>Life goes better the more pleasure you have and the less suffering.
Utilitarianism	"Ethical theory that<i> prescribes / recommends one do actions</i> which maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals&nbsp;<br><br><b>gg for gn</b><br>Encourages the <span style=""font-weight:600"">greatest good for the greatest number&nbsp;</span>"
Kantian Ethics	"<b>Ethical theory</b>&nbsp;: prescribes / recommends one <i>do actions</i> they would be ok with everyone else doing as well <br><br>Based on <span style=""font-weight:600"">categorical imperative (ultimate rule) </span>which has 4 parts : <br><br>- <b>universalizability </b>(treat people the way you would be ok being treated) , <br>- <b>humanity </b>as an end (do not use people as a means to an end), <br>- <b>formula </b>of autonomy (act in a sense of duty derived from rational will), <br>- <b>kingdom </b>of ends (actions guided by principles that could be accepted by all rational beings)"
Formula of Universal law	Kant's Formula of Universal Law states: “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”
Prisoners dilemma	The prisoners dilemma is a thought experiment in which two rational agents can either cooperate for a mutual benefit or betray their partner for an individual reward.
Ethical egoist	<b>definition</b><br>The moral theory that we have no duties to others and that each person ought to pursue their own self-interests exclusively. <br><b>view of other people</b><br>Other people only matter insofar as they can benefit us.
Cultural differences argument	"The cultural differences argument states that cultures have different moral beliefs, practices and traditions. In other words meaning that there is <span style=""font-weight:600"">no universal moral truth</span>."
Ethical Subjectivist	People have different opinions, but where morality is concerned there are no “facts”, and no one is “right”. People just feel differently about things.
Cultural relativist	"<span style=""font-weight:600"">definition<br>Cultural relativism</span>&nbsp;is the position that there is <i>no universal standard to measure cultures by</i>, and that all cultural values and beliefs must be understood relative to their cultural context, and not judged based on outside norms and values. <br><b>main argument</b><br>Proponents of cultural relativism also tend to argue that the norms and values of one culture should not be evaluated using the norms and values of another."
Objectivist	"<span style=""font-weight:600"">definition - achieve happiness<br>Objectivism</span>&nbsp;holds that there is no greater moral goal than <i>achieving one's happiness</i>. But one cannot achieve happiness by wish or whim. <br><b>actions - respect reality and others</b><br>It requires rational respect for the facts of reality, including the facts about our human nature and needs. It requires living by objective principles, including moral integrity and respect for the rights of others. <br><b>political view</b><br>Politically, Objectivists advocate&nbsp;<i>laissez-faire</i>&nbsp;capitalism."
Minimum concept of morality	"Morality is, at the very least,<b> the effort to</b> <br><span style=""font-style:italic"">guide one’s conduct by reason<br></span>—that is, to do what there are the best reasons for doing—while <br><span style=""font-style:italic"">giving equal weight to the interests of each individual affected by one’s action </span>; <br><b>key parts are :</b> <br>- reason <br>- impartiality <br>=&gt; in the treatment of others and in considering the impact of ones actions on others"
Tragedy of commons order preference	Our “preference” is one which maximizes our own benefit while minimizing our suffering ; so the order is : enough cooperate but I don’t → we all cooperate → no one cooperates → i cooperate but enough others don’t
Contractualism	"A set of rules <span style=""font-weight:600"">based on self-interest </span>which people must follow to build a stable and cooperative society. These rules must be agreed upon by the people of the society ; A prerequisite is that enough people must have already signed ( for there to be an effect ) so that you sign (self-interest)."
Tragedy of commons	Should a number of people enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource (a commons) such as a pasture, they will tend to over-use it, and may end up destroying its value altogether. Even if some users exercised voluntary restraint, the other users would merely supplant them, the predictable result being a tragedy for all. ; The order of preference is one where I gain the most by doing the least.
The Experience Machine	A hypothetical machine which can give you any experience which you desired&nbsp;<br>Question :&nbsp;What else matters to use, other than how our lives feel from the inside ?<br>Key takeaways&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;Its only because we want to first do an action that we want the experience of doing the action<br>-&nbsp;Simply floating in a tank means you aren’t actually being defined as a person, one cannot comment on if you are intelligent, caring or witty etc.<br>-&nbsp;Plugging into the machine limits us to man-made reality. That is, it limits us to what we can make.<br>=&gt;&nbsp;<b>conclusion&nbsp;</b>:&nbsp;A possible conclusion is that we desired to live ourselves, in contact with reality.
Utilitarianism and Consequence	"From the utilitarian perspective when determining if an action is right we should look at <span style=""font-style:italic"">what will happen as a result of doing it</span>."
Utilitarianism and treatment of others	"Utilitarianism advocates for treating each persons happiness as equally important. 
The two main problems with this are that it places to great of a demand on us and that it would tell us to do things which would destroy our personal relationships."
The social contract / Contractualism&nbsp;	"<b>definition</b><br>A set of rules people must follow to build a stable and cooperative society. These rules must be agreed upon by the people of the society ; <br><b>properties</b><br>The contract is what affords us to care about others; allowing for <span style=""font-style:italic"">altruism</span>. As opposed to the state of nature where its every man for themselves. ;&nbsp;<br><b>morality</b><br>Morality consists in the set of rules, governing behavior, that rational people will accept, on the condition that others accept them as well."

Invisible hand hypothesis	If people pursue their self-interest, then free markets will lead to a socially desirable outcome.
Problems with Hedonism&nbsp;	"<div>Of course not all pleasures are equal, different kinds of pleasures are felt riding a motorcycle and admiring a painting.</div>
<div>Additionally there can be secondary experiences associated with pleasure.</div>
<div>⚠️Different pleasurable experiences should count differently.<br><br><div>We can live impoverished lives even though we are happy or conversely we can be unhappy even though we live affluent lives if we fail to appreciate privilege.</div>
<div>⚠️ The point here being that there is more to well-being than pleasure alone.&nbsp;</div></div>"
Problems with Objective List Theory	"<div>Difficult to rank the well-being of people who fare differently with respect to different items on the list.</div>
<div>Well-being is a multidimensional concept and to come to an adequate assessment for policy we have to look at all morally relevant aspects of a situation.</div>"

How does utilitarianism distinguish itself from other ethical theories	A defining feature of utilitarianism was that-different to other ethical theories-it does not define some set of rules which must be followed. <br>⚠️Utilitarianism defines ethics as the most happiness of beings in the world and our necessity to bring about the most happiness.

Well-being	"Well-being is defined differently by different theories. Each theory presents a different understanding of a person’s overall happiness, health, and life satisfaction.<span style=""font-weight:600"">
<br>&nbsp;Well-being theories</span>: hedonism, desire satisfaction, objective list theory"
theories of well-being on money	"<span style=""font-weight:600"">Hedonism</span>: money matters only when it brings you more pleasure or happiness.

<br><span style=""font-weight:600"">Desire satisfaction</span>: money matters as long as it enables you to get what you want.

<br><span style=""font-weight:600"">Object list theorists</span>: money matters only if it promotes “objective” goods (such as health, education, friendship, freedom, safety)"
"theories of well-being on ""<span style=""font-weight:600"">happy and poor or sad and rich""</span>"	"<span style=""font-weight:600"">Hedonism</span>: it’s better to be happy and poor because well-being depends on happiness.

<br><span style=""font-weight:600"">Desire satisfaction</span>: it’s better to be happy and poor because well-being depends on being satisfied.

<br><span style=""font-weight:600"">Object list theorists</span>: it’s better to be sad and rich because well-being depends on criteria like opportunities, jobs, and social network."
Key difference between Utilitarianism vs Contractualism &amp; Ethical egoism	"Utilitarianism starts from the <span style=""font-weight:600"">assumption that everyone matters equally</span> and not from the idea that we should promote our self-interests.
<br>&nbsp;It looks at the <span style=""font-weight:600"">consequences of everyone involved</span>."
Common misunderstandings of utilitarianism	"<span style=""font-weight:600"">We can still take risks under utilitarianism

<br></span>For example, we may still ignore the chance that we will die from a meteorite if we go outside.<br><br><span style=""font-weight:600"">We shouldn’t always run utilitarian calculus before acting

<br></span>In some instances, there is no time for calculations. In daily life, we may just follow rules of thumb like “don’t lie” and “adhere to the laws”. But if we want to determine whether we are doing the right thing, we should use the utilitarian calculus."
Kantian ethics vs other moral theories (contractualism &amp; utilitarianism)	"Kantian ethics does not ask:
<br>1. whether it would be in our self-interest to accept some contract, or
<br>2. about the consequences for the well-being of everyone involved.
<br>=&gt; Kantian ethics <span style=""font-weight:600"">asks about the intentions</span> on which you act.<br><br>Kantian ethics prioritizes good intentions. <br>Utilitarianism prioritizes good consequences.
<br><br>&nbsp;(To test good intentions we sometimes still look at consequences though not at actual/expected consequences as utilitarianism does but at “hypothetical” consequences)"
Common misunderstanding with formula of humanity	"You can use others but only if your intention is good.

<br><span style=""font-weight:600"">Example</span>: using your mailman to bring me my orders, using your professor for lectures…"
Formula of humanity view of human rights	We should respect human rights (life and liberty) because people wouldn’t agree to our plans if we wouldn’t.
